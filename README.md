# Project Summary

## Overview
The project involves designing and simulating a network for a faculty moving to a new campus, utilizing only two class C networks. The network consists of 410 hosts distributed across seven different locations with seven different topologies. Teams of 3 to 5 members are tasked with implementing LAN network topologies, subnetting them, protecting with NAT methods, testing routing methods, and securing the networks with access lists.

## Project Requirements
1. **LAN Topologies:** Five different LAN network topologies are implemented on Cisco Packet Tracer, each connected to a router. LANs are sub-netted with class C IPs.
2. **Servers:** Two servers are added to routers with class B IPs.
3. **NAT:** Three types of NAT (Static, Dynamic, PAT) are illustrated.
4. **Dynamic Routing:** OSPF and eIGRP are implemented for the whole network.
5. **Security:** Extended access lists are created to filter network traffic for all LANs and servers.
6. **Additional Bonus:** Various bonus features such as DHCP server, DNS server, Firewall, FTP server, SSH server, VLSM, port security, etc., can be added.

## Deliverables
- Detailed report (minimum 10 pages) documenting all steps.
- Packet Tracer files: One for OSPF routing,another for eIGRP routing and RIP routing
- Demo video illustrating project testing (maximum length: 120 seconds).
